# WhozWho Client Project Rules

## Memory Bank Rules
- Complete memory bank rules are documented in `memory-bank/memory-bank-rules.md`
- All memory bank files MUST be read at the start of EVERY task
- Documentation updates occur when:
  - Discovering new project patterns
  - After implementing significant changes
  - When user requests with **update memory bank**
  - When context needs clarification

## Project Patterns
- Memory bank structure implemented following memory-bank/memory-bank-rules.md
- All project documentation maintained in memory-bank/ directory
- Core files hierarchy:
  1. projectbrief.md (foundation)
  2. productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md
  3. activeContext.md
  4. progress.md
